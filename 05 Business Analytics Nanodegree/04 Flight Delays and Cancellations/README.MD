For this portfolio project, I created a series of visualizations to analyze airline delay patterns. A vertical bar chart highlighted the average delay time across various airports, revealing Hawaiian Airlines Inc. as the airline with the highest delays. A map visualization showcased delay patterns geographically, with Falls International Airport standing out for the highest average delay. Lastly, a monthly comparison of delay types showed that late aircraft delays were the most significant, while security-related delays were consistently the lowest.
