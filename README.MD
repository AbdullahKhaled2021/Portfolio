## Fourth Project

### Projcet Title
Managing a BI project for Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in New York City.

### About Projcet
Cyclisticâ€™s Customer Growth Team is creating a business plan for next year. The team wants to understand how their customers are using their bikes; their top priority is identifying customer demand at different station locations. The dataset includes millions of rides, so the team wants a dashboard that summarizes key insights. Business plans that are driven by customer insights are more successful than plans driven by just internal staff observations. The executive summary must include key data points that are summarized and aggregated in order for the leadership team to get a clear vision of how customers are using Cyclistic. 

I've created the realted project documents such: SDR (Stakeholder Requirements Document), PRD (Project Requirements Document) & SD (Strategy Document), as well as a dashboard using tableau public to provide insights about the project.
