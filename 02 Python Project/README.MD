### About Projcet 
In this project, i used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States like Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 

I wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics, as well as writing a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
